How to build the first time
===========================
* Configure a valid gvSIG workspace
* Add the following aditional projects:

  * extNavtable: https://github.com/navtable/navtable
  * extELLE: http://gitorious.org/elle
  * fonsagua: https://github.com/fonsagua/fonsagua
  * extDBConnection: http://gitorious.org/extdbconnection/

* It's also suggested add extNavtableForms (with this project name) to the workspace.

  * extNavtableForms: https://github.com/navtable/navtableforms

* TODO: Create a script / ant target that allows checks that the needed dependencies are configured on the workspace. Also this should compile all the projects that are not from gvSIG
* Compile gvSIG, extNavtable, extELLE and fonsagua
* Configure the file db_config_devel, with the parameters of postgis devel enviroment
* Execute the script db/fonsagua.sh. This will remove the fonsagua database in your cluster and re-create it with the needed information


Forms devel rules
=================

* Abeille files: The ui generated by abeille in xml format and located in the *forms* folder.
* Domain files: The domain / rules files that define some of the behaviour of the form. They are located in the *domains* folder.
* Alias files: Files written in the navtable alias style (java properties). They are located in the *alias* folder, and have .alias as extension. The alias, should be the same as the text of the jlabel that match the widget where the data is introduced.

The name of this files must be the same of the database table. The name of the Java file, should be the name of the table with Form as suffix. As example, for the table comunidades:

forms/comunidades.xml
domains/comunidades.xml
alias/comunidades.alias
src/**/ComunidadesForm.java
