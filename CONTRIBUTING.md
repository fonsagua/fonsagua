# Contributing

Thanks for taking time to read this document. Even if finally you don't contribute to the project it makes us happy that you use it.

This project expects that all contributions follow the rules and use the tools described in this document. Anyway, if you don't follow it we will review your patch, but it can take longer to be integrated.

-   iCarto projects try to ensure a strict code style. The selected code style, the tools used and the rationale behind it are explained [here](https://gitlab.com/icarto/ikdb/blob/master/estilo_codigo). For busy people there is [a summary here](https://gitlab.com/icarto/ikdb/blob/master/estilo_codigo/0.resumen.md) that explains how to configure the tools.
